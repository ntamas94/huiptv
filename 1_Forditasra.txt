A Unity Lovagjai nevében:
Dicsőség a Bárány-nak, a nagy hatalom közvetítőjének, az Alant Várakozó Megígért Felszabadítójának!
Azonban áldozati állat, légy óvatos; mert egy Korona nem ülhet két homlokon.
Mi lenne egy pásztor a nyáj nélkül?
És a Pásztor utat készít a pusztában; folyókat a sivatagban; és fényt a sötétben.
Szenvedésből győzelem születik; ami egyszer elpusztult, most ragadozóvá válik.
Bárány, akit egyszer a Fogoly Isten nevében levágtak, gondolkodj el; most kinek a nevében vágod le?
Áldozatból újjászületett Eszköz, emelkedj fel újra, és vedd fel igazi formádat; már nem szolga, nem kevesebb, mint egy Isten.
Lelkek pásztora, vezesd őket most az Utána-ba, hogy ne tévesszék el az utat.
A Bárány által élhetünk; és idővel, a Bárány által halhatunk meg.
Ekkora nagyságot tanúskodva, és ezt az igazságot megosztva, megszületik a Bárány Evangéliuma.
Térj meg; mert felkelt a Bárány Királysága.
Visszalök minden ellenséget a hatótávolságodon belül, miközben sebezi is őket.
Átok azokra, akik nem méltók a jelenlétedre.
Isteni Robbanás
Küldj el egy átható tűzgömböt.
Küldd el az Alvilág lángjait.

Mindegyikünket át kell haladni, idővel.
Hozz létre egy örvényt, amely vonzza az ellenségeket felé.
Halál söprése
Zúzd le a bűnösöket a földre.
Egy pusztító közelharci támadás, amit növelhetsz az erőd feltöltésével.
Hívj elő erőteljes csápokat, amelyek hevesen tombolnak.
Hajótörő, mélyből feltámadt.
Turua érintése
Egy jól kiegyensúlyozott penge, mérsékelt sebzést okozva.
Hűséges társ a vándor harcosnak.
Kereszteslovag kardja
Egy hatalmas eszköz, amely megállíthatatlan brutalitást hoz.
Vágd ketté magát a földet.
Apostol hasítója
Egy halálosan szegecselt kesztyűkészlet.
Egy vasökle, ahonnan senki sem menekülhet.
Tempestus öklek
Gyors penge, sok vágással, alacsony sebzéssel, de villámgyors.
Legjobb hátsó támadásokra.
Áruló borotvája
Lassan zuhan, de pusztítóan érkezik.
A bíróság kalapácsa, üss célba.

Very good, my vessel. It seems I chose well when I kept you from Death.
I will be watching your every move.
Do not disappoint me.
Vessel, you have shown yourself worthy. You are ready to hear of your purpose.
You see me here in chains, reduced to nothing. But it has not always been thus.
I was bound to this wretched place by the 
Bishops of the Old Faith.
 They betrayed me and left me to rot.
Each of the four chains that bind me are guarded by one of the 
Bishops.
Destroy the 
Bishop
 and you break the chain. Break all four and I will be freed.
I gave you life anew, vessel, and now you must repay the debt. You know what must be done.
You know what must be done.
Do not make the mistake of becoming the servant of your Followers. They are for you to use to 
your advantage! 
Their faith is a resource, spend it as you would gold. For you can always regain their trust with a well placed gesture of kindness.
Let it empower you, let it give you license to do unspeakable things. 
Bend them to your will. 
Fear not, for you are my chosen vessel and death cannot halt you.
I shall not allow it, for I still have need of you.
Take what you have gathered. Build and strengthen the Cult. This is how power is gained.
Continue on, undaunted. Each time you are brought down, you rise again stronger.
Death is of little consequence. Rise once more, vessel of mine.
It matters not how many times you are struck down. The Cult shall continue to grow.
Your merciless crusade against the 
Old Faith
 warms my cold, unbeating heart.
Soon I shall be freed, and the world remade in my image.
All will pledge themselves to the Cult. All will bow to my name.
I knew I chose wisely when I saved you. You have done well.
Continue your ruthless pursuit of the heretics, destroy all in your path and show 
no mercy.
Leshy fell before you like a grain of sand before a tidal wave.
One chain destroyed. Three remain.
Heket
 will be the next of the Bishops for you to face. You will find her in 
Anura.
Return to the Cult. I shall open your way to 
Anura.
I enjoyed watching you destroy Heket. Her arrogance was always destined to be her undoing.
The remaining Bishops will be growing wary of you now. Tread carefully.
Upon your return to the Cult, I shall open the next door so you may continue your journey.
Kallamar was always a coward. This land is a better place now his pathetic, snivelling carcass is nothing more than a mound of rotting flesh.
Only Shamura remains. When you are ready, you know what must be done.
Shamura was weak, not wise. Their vision was too small to contain the multitudes of one such as I.
The time has come to free me. You shall have the honour of returning the Red Crown to its true bearer.
I admit, you have worn it almost as well as I could have myself.
You allowed 
 Followers to starve to death, because you knew they were barely worth the food they were fed.
You sacrificed 
 Followers to strengthen the Cult - to strengthen 
us.
You murdered 
 Followers in cold blood. I believe you enjoyed it.
Your appetite for death is something I can admire, Vessel. But the Crown is mine, and none - 
none
 - are worthy. None other than I.
You shall lay down your life and return to me what is mine. After millenia, all may bask in my glory once more.
But it cannot be done here. The final gate awaits. Hurry now, the time is at hand.
That is the power I have granted you, that is your 
right
 as Leader.
Vessel, do you not worship me? Do you not give offerings in hopes of gaining my favor?
When you return to your Cult you shall find a new 
Offering Chest.
 There you can provide offerings that I, in my generosity, shall turn to gold, so that you might strengthen the Cult.
But I am not easily satisfied. The same gift offered too frequently will cause the price to be lowered. Yet fear not - over time, it will grow in value once more.
Give me proper tribute and you shall be rewarded.
So, you fed Ratau to the wolves. Your treacherous opportunism has far exceeded my expectations.
Ratau was an adequate servant, yet lacked the ruthlessness you have so eloquently displayed.
He renounced his position after striking a bargain that resulted in the sacrifice of a Follower. He was weak, and allowed my Temple to descend into ruin. I see that is not a problem you share.
I sent Ratau to aid you, but this pleases me greatly. A great Vessel takes their master’s will as their own. Very well done.
I grant you the power to read their 
feeble little minds.
To defeat the bishops you will need to become stronger. Sacrifice a follower to absorb more power - this will aid you in your quest to free me.

Come closer. Fear not, for though you are 
already dead,
 I still have 
need of you.
Those foolish 
Bishops
 thought they could keep you from me in death. But instead they sent you 
straight to me.
I will give you 
life
 again, but at a 
price!
All I ask is for you to start a
 Cult 
in my name. Do we have a deal?
Wise choice...
Take the 
Red Crown
 which I once wore. With it you shall command the 
loyalty
 of Followers and strike 
fear
 into the hearts of our enemies.
Return to the land of the living, start a Cult in my name and begin recruiting Followers.
Once you have done so, you will see me again. Now, 
go!
Before us stands the last of its kind. All others we have hunted down and put to the blade.
With this final sacrifice, the 
prophecy
 will be 
impossible
 to fulfill.
The 
heretic
 who lies bound below will be condemned to eternal captivity.
And the 
Old Faith
 shall be preserved.
you!!!
 Listen, 
mutton chop
 - you owe me a ship!
The 
Bishops
 are nasty pieces o’ work but they do a good enough job of keeping the waterways 
open
 and trade 
flowing
 ‘round here.
But with you going around 
killing them
 it opens the gates for all sorts o' monstrous beasts to start 
sinking
 my stock!
Scary things they be, with 
gnashing
 teeth and 
odiferous
 stinks and a face that could 
curdle milk!
just like me mother-in-law 
ah ah ah ah
So you best be making this right! Each time a Bishop dies, a nasty beast called a 
Witness
 takes its place.
Lucky for ye Plimbo knows folk will pay a 
pretty penny
 for the 
Eye of a Witness.
 Ye get me their eyes, I buy a new boat, and we'll call it square.
All ye need to do is return to places ye've killed a Bishop, defeat the ferocious beast that has emerged, and bring me their eyes! Simple enough.
So ye've really done it, ye damned Lamb. Ye've slain all 
four
 of the 
Witnesses!
Plimbo's a creature of me word, and savvy with the business. I'll follow ye.
All Plimbo asks in return is you keep me waterways safe and me trade secure!
I'll even sell you some of me wares. No discounts, but! Don't get too big for ye tiny britches, Lamb.
About time! Look at this squishy thing!
They say these creatures have seen all there is to see, and stood in silent judgement for millennia.
just like me mother-in-law 
ah ah ah
Here, take this. Found it on me travels. Means naught to me, but a crown bearer might have some use for it.
Three more to go!
You got another eye? Plimbo is starting to 
see
 your appeal. 
ha!
Truly, safety and security is something Plimbo takes seriously - especially in me line of business.
But I could never bow me head to another... so don't think you'll be able to convert old Plimbo!
Only two more to go. Take this as a token of me thanks.
This be the third eye! Ye are even more deadly than Plimbo thought!
Hmm... Plimbo needs safety for me trade, and the Lamb can give that... but Plimbo is a wild soul. I serve no one but meself!
But then again, the last 
Witness
 could sink me ship, me trade, me way of life. And then what’ll be left of Plimbo?
Fine!
 Force me hand. Bring me that last eye and I’ll bow me head to you and your ways.
I'll take that! Here, this is for you.
An eye for an eye, indeed!
Want a closer look at the finest antiquities in the lands of the Old Faith, Lamb?
That's right, as long as me ships a-floatin', Plimbo's open for business!
If this wets ye whistle, come down to me Sanctuary! Plenty of fine, legally acquired goods! Har har!
Thanks for ye patronage!
Tell ye friends about Plimbo's wares!
Good day to ye, Lamb.
This ain't no charity! Come back when ye've got gold to spend.
No freebies!
See? Now get out of here!
Hey kiddo, keep your eyes off my fishies!
There ain't enough for the both of us. The best fishing can be found at 
Pilgrim's Passage.
Where's that, you say? Lemme show you...
Well, look what the tide dragged in.
What’re you just standing there for? Think I'm gonna fish for you? I'm not one of your mindless acolytes!
Hm. Not so useless after all.
Listen, perhaps we could help one another. I happen to have caught some extremely 
valuable
 treasures in my time.
Things that a fish like me- err, I mean a fisherMAN like me - has no use for. But to you... well. You look like you like valuable things!
Below these waves lurk some of the hardest to catch beasts that ever lived, and I've been trying for years.
If you can snag 'em, these 
treasures
 are yours.
Catch me a 
 Crab, a 
 Lobster, an 
 Octopus, and a 
 Squid.
Take this. As a gesture of good faith between two non-fish friends.
Ooh! So close.
You nearly had it! Be patient.
Perhaps this ain't for you. You've been outsmarted three times - that makes you three times dumber than a fish. 
ha!
Not bad! Not bad at all! You're a pro with the pole.
You've stocked me up, nice and good. If you find the fishin' scarce, I'll sell 'em!
Lobster! Very good, very good.
As promised, here's a bit o' treasure.
Pinch me! Is that a crab?
This gave me such a fight, I thought I'd hooked a whale. It's yours now.
Ahh, the elusive squid. Wonderful!
Here take this, caught it maybe 50 years ago. No use to me.
Finally! An octopus.
As soon as I'd pulled this out the waves I knew no mortal would have need of this. That's where you come in.
Oh mighty 
Bishops of the Old Faith
! We ask you to accept the sacrifice of this wretched soul -
Hey! Who interrupts our ritual and trespasses on 
sacred ground?!
Hello child. I know you. You're a friend of Ratau’ssss?
I recognise that Crown on your head. Ratau has told me alllll about you.
I'm on my way to visit him for a game of 
Knucklebonesss!
 Hehehehe.
I have debtsss to pay and debtsss to gain!
Well, well, child. You found your way here. Fancy a match? Be warned, I play for keepsss.
 what!? 
 I sssupose you’d better take thisss...
Ha! Jussst as I thought.
I sssssuuuckk...
Hello, wee Lamb! Fancy seeing you somewhere dangerous like this!
I'm Klunko. This is Bop!
We're off to our friend Ratau's for a night of drinking and dicing! It's going to be quite the party!
Ratau and the others know me for going overboard with the betting. Last time I bet and lost my hand!
Talk about overplaying your HAND! Ha ha! It was hilarious. I'll win it back, though.
Say, you should come. You seem tough, rich and fond of risk - perfect for 
Knucklebones!
Wee Lamb! Glad you could make it. How about a match?
Ha! Not bad. Take this. I’d try to win it back, but I don’t think I can lose another hand! Blasted 
Shrumy!
Don't feel bad, you put up a good fight!
Ha, that was fun! Bop says 'congratulations!' Lamby did great, didn't they Bop?
What are you looking at?
Hmf. That's right. You crown bearers are all the same. Nothing without your 
adoring
 Followers.
Ratau wasn't like that. He stayed true to who he was. You'll NEVER live up to him.
Get out of my way, I've got 
Knucklebones
 to play and money to win.
Come and play me if you want a 
real challenge.
Hmf. It’s you. Finally decide to join the big leagues?
You got lucky. Take this. Now, rematch? Or are you a coward?
Ha! If only we’d played for parts - I could use a 
lamb chop
 to go with Klunko's hand!
Hmf. Again?
Praise be! Your Followers can now 
worship you!
Here is a new Follower. Assign them to Worship at the 
Shrine.
Then collect the Devotion 
 your Followers generate at the Shrine to unlock 
Divine Inspiration.
Now we must build a 
Shrine
 - but first we will need more Followers 
 and more gold 
Both of which can be found when crusading through the lands of 
The Old Faith.
Our mutual benefactor 
The One Who Waits
 has been trapped by the four 
Bishops of the Old Faith.
 Each of them guards a chain that binds him to the realm beyond.
We have conjured openings to their realms. It is your task to track them down and 
slay
 them so that he may be freed.
Now 
go!
 There you shall find gold 
 and willing recruits 
 and for those who are not willing, convert them by 
force! 
The Temple is where you will perform 
Rituals
 to grow 
stronger
 and 
preach Sermons
 to 
mould
 the minds of your Followers.
You are responsible for maintaining the 
Faith
 of your Cult. If it falls too low, your Followers will 
dissent
 against you and eventually leave.
Preaching 
sermons,
 performing 
rituals
 and providing for the 
needs
 of your Followers will keep their 
Faith
 high.
Your Followers are ready to hear your word. Show them that you are their 
great leader
. Preach a 
Sermon
 from within your Temple.
You were amazing to behold. A natural leader. I see why you were chosen.
Your Followers are the key to your strength. If you are to grow stronger, you must indoctrinate more to unlock a 
Faith of the Flock
 Ritual.
The bones 
 of your enemies are required to perform such 
Rituals.
Destroy
 their skeletons to gather their bones 
Return to the lands of the 
Old Faith,
 gather bones from fallen enemies, recruit more Followers and return to perform a 
Ritual
 here in the Temple.
By your hand, our Cult will grow 
powerful!
 But your Followers can not live on prayer alone, 
they must eat.
Gather the necessary resources and build a 
Cooking Fire.
 It will allow you to prepare 
meals
 for your Followers.
This hallowed ground which once was mine, is now yours. This 
crumbling
 ruin is to be the site of your new 
Cult. 
We have much to do. We begin by 
indoctrinating
 this poor soul into the warm embrace of your 
Cult.
Followers can gather 
resources
 for you. Order this one to collect 
 Lumber or 
 Stone.
One final thing - should you find things moving much too slowly, you can 
Meditate.
It will be as if 
time has stopped for you
 while the world around continues to spin.
I am relieved to see you made it safely, and you have not returned alone. You have convinced more to join our faithful flock.
Let us indoctrinate this new convert so that we may continue.
Followers will either 
work
 or 
worship
. Worshipping Followers generate Devotion 
 for you to collect.
But to collect Devotion 
 you require a 
Shrine
Build a 
Shrine
Indoctrinating followers is well and good, but there is so much more you can 
take from them.
Give them gifts, complete quests and perform blessings for them and you will increase their 
loyalty
 to you. Once they are totally loyal to you, they will give you 
everything
 they own.
Watch as I show you. You, Follower, come back in here!
The more loyal Followers you have, the stronger you'll become.
Fear not! I am Ratau. I was once a chosen vessel like you, but those days are lost to the winds.
I was sent to guide you. We are deep in the lands of the 
Old Faith
 and in grave danger.
My instructions are to lead you to safety. Continue through the woods. Escape lies ahead. I will be close by.
We have nearly reached safety, but look ahead! Another poor soul about to be 
sacrificed.
Rescue them and they would have 
no choice
 but to join your new Cult.
We have reached safety. You have done well.
The 
Red Crown
 will allow you to use those markings on the ground to transport yourself great distances.
It will take you to a temple that has fallen to ruin. There you will be able to begin your new Cult.
I will meet you there.
I must thank you. By relieving me of my duties you have granted me what I desire most: peace.
Now that I have taught you everything you need to know, I can pass my days playing 
Knucklebones. 
I have friends on their way to join me for a game or two as we speak. A 
rowdy bunch
 to be sure, but now I am retired I am free to enjoy myself.
See this humble shrine to which I pray? Giving offerings to it will grant you new 
Crown Abilities.
 Here, let me show you.
I have tried many times to write this letter to you, only to find myself unable to express what I wish to say.
Likely I will scrap this as well and toss it on the growing pile of failed attempts. But still I try.
Whilst teaching you, I have begun to think of you as... well, I hope you could think of me as...
You are already better than I ever was. I know you will not make the same mistakes I did.
I am proud of you.
I received this trinket from my predecessor, and now I wish to pass it on to you.
Your dear friend and mentor, 
Ratau
You have discovered my humble cottage. Be careful you don't make the same mistakes I did, or you will end up in a place just like this.
Now, perhaps a game of Knucklebones? You don't know it? Why, it's simple.
Step up to the table and I will show you.
By the One Below! You're a natural! Here, you've earned yourself a 
prize.
Now you've had a taste of the game... care to wager some coin?
Haha! No one can beat the 
great Ratau
 at Knucklebones! Care to play again?
It seems fortune is not on my side. No matter, you played well.
I am glad I found you. I bring good news!
The One Who Waits 
is pleased with your progress and wishes to grant you a 
Crown Ability.
Enemies you slay will now drop 
Fervour.
 Collect this to replenish your Curses.
Collecting 
Fervour
 also contributes to unlocking 
Divine Inspiration.
I have much to teach you, but I am old and grow weary. Visit me at my home and I will show you how to harness the true 
power
 of the 
Red Crown!
Hungry? I have what you need.
Fresh, fresh, fresh! You won't find better.
Only the finest ingredients from across the Lands of the Old Faith.
Food for your soul, your 
undying
 soul.
Delicious! Enjoy, traveller.
Ooh, a wonderful choice.
Payment is required!
Don't you dare touch my love!!
 I'm warning you! 
 stop it 
Okay, that's it! Prices are now double. Hope you are happy.
That we lived three summer days, I could fill my heart with such delight, more than fifty common years...
You need listen only to your heart, for there lie your truest desires!
One can be certain of nothing but the heart’s affections!
O for a life of sensations of the heart rather than of thoughts!
Beauty is truth, truth beauty, and that is all ye need know of your heart.
Oh but a thing of beauty is a joy forever!
Woe betide me! Thou hast not the coin. Hearts beat, and hearts break...
Yessss, you like? I find many of these tasty morsels...
Maybe I keep this one... I grow hungry...
I loves the crunch 
crunch
 of their little bones!
Tiny, pathetic creatures! But so tasty...
Don't eat them all at once!
Come back now...
Tasty morsels cannot be for nothing!
You must hunger muchly... have this one on the house.
My number one customer, back again! For you...
This one doesn't look tasty. You can have for free.
I can feel Fate's hand on the cards this night.
Tell me, Lamb; do you believe destiny immutable?
Are we all but players in this game of chance?
Lend yourself to the draw of a card.
The Fates have spoken. Who will listen?
You cannot argue with the draw. One might as well argue with the ocean.
Your cards have been drawn. The path lays ahead.
All is as it should be, as it ever was, as it always will be
Praise the Lamb, conduit to great power, promised liberator of the One that Waits below.
Yet sacrificial beast, take heed; for a Crown cannot sit upon two brows.
…so the cards showed me, once. Many lifetimes ago. (Or has that yet to be?)
I have always drawn your cards, Lamb. And yet, this is the first.
Do they dictate Fate, or merely show its symptoms? Do we shape the world, or are we shaped by it?
Take these cards, and I will draw another each time we meet. When drawn by me, they will grant you 
power.
Your deck decides your fate. You may find more upon your Crusades, and I will draw from them. Look upon it now.
Please don't hurt us! We are simple Followers, lost in an unfamiliar place.
The great 
Sozo
 sent us to find more of his beloved 
Menticide Mushrooms.
He cares only for mushrooms. His madness grows!
But when we arrived, we realised we don't know how to find 
Menticide Mushrooms...
 and now we are too afraid to return empty handed.
If you were to bring him 
Menticide Mushrooms
 he would certainly reward you. You will find him at 
Spore Grotto.
Greetings traveller... me? Why I am 
Sozo
 of course! Researcher of all things mushrooms... guess that makes me a 
fun-guy!
Just a little joke Sozo likes to tell.
Yes, yes! Mushrooms! Mushrooms are Sozo’s passion. But 
Sozo
 need more! 
Sozo
always
 need more...
You will collect for 
Sozo
, yes? 
Yes!
Sozo
 can't trust my followers out there. They lie, they steal, they whisper secrets about 
Sozo
i just know it!
Sozo
 will show you a way to 
open the minds
 of even the most stubborn, skeptical, square creatures! Perfect for, one who leads a Cult such as yourself!
Yes, yes! Bring 
Sozo
 mushrooms! Bring 
Sozo
 every mushroom you can find! 
bring sozo mushrooms or sozo will tear off your head!
Hmm...
Why should I?
Sozo
 will do anything! I’ll worship at your altar! 
Sozo
 will devote myself to your cause! 
i’ll rip off your head!
Ahem... 
Sozo
 will show you how to use the 
power of the mushrooms
 to open the fragile little minds of your Followers!
But you do not need to use it on 
Sozo
! Oh no! 
Sozo
 will follow willingly. As long as you keep bringing 
Sozo
 mushrooms, 
Sozo
 will do 
anything
Take the path to 
Anura
 and find 
Sozo
 mushrooms! You may not have seen them before, but now you seek them, they shall be there now.
Bring me more! More! MORE! 
Shhh…
 keep it down, or 
they
 will hear...
Sozo
 trusts you, only you, everyone else is out to get Sozo, but not you, 
Sozo
 loves you, Sozo needs you…
What? Are you 
spying
 on 
Sozo
Go away! Come back with mushrooms!
Yes! Yes! Give 
Sozo
 give 
Sozo
give 
sozo
Excellent... Excellent! But not 
enough
. Bring 
Sozo
 more and 
Sozo
 will show you how to brainwash those Followers of yours.
Yes, 
yes!
 These will do just fine!
Okay, 
Sozo
 will share with you this ritual, but you must not show anyone!
Stand back... or you will get brainwashed too.
DONE! As you can see now 
Sozo's
 loyal Followers are 
brainwashed.
They will do whatever 
Sozo
 say for a few days, and lose no Faith in Sozo. But afterward many of them will fall sick... but oh well!
Now that you have seen, you can go to your temple and perform the Ritual yourself!
And any more mushrooms you find, 
sozo
 want!
Sozo
 will buy them, all of them.
Sozo
 will buy your mushrooms for 5 
... a good and generous price.
Now, leave 
Sozo
 to his research. There is much to investigate and extrapolate from these fine specimens.
Cards! Cards!
Cards?
Cards?
No gold? No cards!
Yes! Cards for you!
Bye bye cards!
Please understand, great Lamb! Sozo cannot be giving things away for free. Do not hate Sozo!
O Bless the gracious Lamb!
Sozo thanks you for your patronage!
How can this be?
You were put to the blade, Lamb, as all your kind were. And yet here you stand before me, unrepentant.
So you foolishly persist, 
little Lamb.
I hear your 
lies
 and I smell your 
fear.
The 
Red Crown
 rises again... but what an 
unworthy
 bearer it has.
So it is true. The 
Red Crown
 sits upon the brow of another.
But how? We did everything we could to-
It matters not. We need not bother 
Shamura
 with this. Deal with it, brother.
As you command, my sister.
Your persistence is beginning to 
annoy
 me, 
little Lamb.
You may think yourself clever. You may think yourself righteous in your service to 
him.
 But you should not be so trusting of the 
Chained One.
Oh, well. It's too late for talk. One such as you deserves no absolution. This will not end well for you.
I grow tired of you, 
little Lamb
Time to put an end to this 
frivolous masquerade
Pathetic, snivelling, vile puppet to the Red Crown.
 You have felled the youngest of us.
We are the Bishops of the Old Faith. We protect against heresies such as yours. We are the guardians of the true word, and we shall not tolerate such blasphemy.
Your sins are many, and for that your loyal Followers must SUFFER!
 They shall Starve!
Wh... wh... where am I? Leader?
Five points to a pentagram, five portents of doom, five siblings stood abreast, five Gods and one tomb...
Shamura!
 We did not wish to bother you, but-
Shamura, the Red Crown grows stronger by the day. Already it has succeeded where 
he
 has failed before. Leshy has been slain!
Five becomes four becomes three becomes two becomes one becomes nothing.
...Shamura, rest. We will deal with this. Won't we, Kallamar?
Yes, sister! Of course, sister!
You there, vessel of the Red Crown! Bow to me, or you will regret it!
Bow
Refuse
Ha! Cowardly vermin. You disgust me.
You will bow, or I will make you!
It was not so long ago that we cast out the Red Crown. A mere thousand or so years.
The heresy it preached could not be tolerated. Such noxious ideals... it could not be allowed.
And with greed and ambition unchecked, it drew Godly blood.
For this most damning of sins, the retribution must be slow and painful.
 I cast a famine upon your Cult!
The one you serve, that monster we have put in chains, will not be satisfied until you have killed all four of us.
You may have killed my brother Leshy, but you will not kill me, and you will not get close to the other Bishops of the Old Faith.
We are far older and more powerful than dear brother Leshy was. 
I will not suffer the same fate as Leshy...
Find me in my temple. You will join your kin in slaughter!
Finally. I have been looking forward to this.
Make your peace, creature. You will not be leaving this temple.
You have come far enough 
little Lamb.
 My Followers are willing to do anything for me. Can you say the same of yours?
I give myself to the cause, oh 
Mighty Leader
By the blood of the Great Ones, 
destroy
 the 
Red Crown
He has sent many vessels like you. One after the other, they all fall.
You have gotten further than most, granted. You have taken two of our own.
I shall enjoy watching your Cult rot from the inside! A disease upon them!\x20
I... I... I don't feel so good
Your friend Ratau was the last vessel sent against us, the snivelling coward. And there were countless before him, all equally pathetic and unworthy.
Nothing humbles quite like 
disease.
 I cast a plague upon your Cult!
It seems you cannot be stopped by disease or hunger. And he sends you back from death stronger each time.
Please know, it was not my idea to cast out the Red Crown! The other Bishops, my siblings, the blame lies with them.
Please, I beg you, spare me. Kill 
Shamura
, but do not send me to my death. Do not send me to 
him!
You will not find my temple. I will be safe there. Yes, I will be safe!
Five becomes four becomes three becomes two becomes one becomes nothing.
Kallamar was always frightened of the Red Crown. Yes, fear made a coward of him.
My door is the next to be knocked upon. 
Knock, knock, the Lamb comes to raze, end of days, end of days.
Begone, beast! Find satisfaction elsewhere.
You will not cross the threshold of my temple!
What? How did you find me?
Please, it wasn't my idea, I didn't want to! I told the others it wouldn't work, not forever. Please!
Are you so unmoved by my plight? Then you leave me no choice. I will not be sent to death by a snivelling puppet like you!
He waits by the rocks of the darkened sea, at the foot of the long, sudden drop.
Within the maw of pointed-teeth beasts, the stutter of the heart, then stopped.
He was the fifth. The fifth Bishop of the Old Faith. Our brother, The One Who Waits. Back then he was known by the name Narinder.
But as millennia wore on, he grew discontent with his role. He began to question. He was gluttonous in his ambition.
And in my imprudence I loved him. For it, I lost my mind. For it, he lost his freedom.
Can you fathom such betrayal, Lamb? Of your own turned against you? Would you like to find out?
Leader... I'm sorry... 
ahhhhhhhh 
I am not what I once was. Though no longer wise, I am no fool. I know the end draws near. I can take some comfort in confession.
The blame hangs heavy 'round my neck. I introduced him to ideas of change; for my domain is knowledge, and it is ever evolving.
An organic state of being for myself, but for him... most unnatural. Death cannot flow backward.
Subjugated as you too soon shall be. Make peace, bow to me, Lamb.
It was I who had him chained. Forced into subjugation by the four of us.
Bow
Refuse
I am disappointed, I admit. I thought my brother had better... taste.
A lion in the guise of a Lamb. I expected no less from a vessel of the Red Crown. Very well. War is also my domain.
Have you thought of what awaits you once your task is completed? What is to become of you?
The lamb is, after all, the sacrificial beast. Bred to slaughter.
If I cannot stop you, then I can at least prepare you for the suffering to come.
I envy you not. While you may yet kill me, still I would not trade places.
It is time to draw this ugly business to a close.
He waits at the point of the sharpened blade, the fate that cannot be outrun. He waits in the eye of the raging storm, at the end of the long day done.
Five becomes... becomes... nothing. Nothing at all.
The duty I owe to my brethren cannot be shirked. My temple awaits.
Insignificant critter! You will learn your place!
You do not understand, Lamb. Heed my warning and 
stay away!
He of havoc, he of blight; she of hunger, they of might.
Five becomes four becomes three becomes two becomes one becomes nothing.
Helloooo there, crusader!
If you make it through the next few combat rooms with nary a scratch - 
taking no damage!
 - I'll rustle you up a reward!
If you pass the next combat rooms without 
using curses
, I shall gift you a gift worth having!
Stand your ground! If you can complete the next combat rooms without 
dodging
, a reward shall be yours.
But if you fail... then alas, naught for you!
Why, aren't you just something? You've completed the challenge.
Hmm, what should you get?
I think this is a decent reward!
Peace be with you Crusader, I seek only the truth and the light. But I may be of service to you.
I can increase the 
Loyalty
 of any Follower you choose.
My work is done. This fool would follow you into the deepest darkness from whence no one returns.
What's this? My efforts have had no effect. Curious...
Are you on the wrong path? If you spare some coin, I shall reshape the map.
They're all dead.... Oh Lord, how could I? Again?
Do you see it in me? The darkness in my soul?
I absolve you, join me.
How could you?
Thank you... master.
Leave me... before it happens again...
I am surrounded by fools that don't see my genius. But you see it don't you lamb?
Admit your stupidity and my intellectual superiority and I will be yours to command!\x20
Yes, I am a fool.
No, I won't.
Perhaps you are not as stupid as you look.
You are a stupid snivelling fool. Stop wasting my time with your feeble mind.
The leader of my Cult is a coward. How can I respect someone who is too afraid to fight?
Is your path forged in blood and fire? Or do you believe in peace and kindness?
I seek war.
Peace.
Then I am yours to command. I shall pledge myself to your Cult.
Another coward... It seems you are not the one I seek.
Hapless 
Leshy
, youngest of the Five. T’was his eyes he lost.
Temperamental 
Heket,
 with her throat cut neat.
Cowardly 
Kallamar’s
 ears, torn from his head.
And 
Shamura
… once the brightest of the Five, 'till their skull were split.
See no evil, speak naught, hear nothing, think none.
The 
One Who Waits
 made it so.
He was unalike the rest of his kin.
For the others dealt with flux; chaos, famine, pestilence, war. Things which in their constancy must transpose.
And yet he was the inevitable; the obstinate and irresistible. The one who waits.
Truly peculiar, ‘twould then seem, his appetency to invite the novel and the new, break ancient vow and primordial bond alike.
Traditions stagnate and appetites augment, nonetheless. Doubt tears faith asunder.
Bonds of familial duty turned instead to chains.
Most voracious of appetites, curbed and contained.
Most infectious of ideas cut off and cauterised before given chance to rot and spread.
Cruel, verily. Alas, what other recourse was given?
How does one kill Death?
One cannot.
Please, spare me...
Convert me to your Cult, I will follow your teachings faithfully!
Leader, I am famished. I fear I have become naught but skin and bones... I beg of you, is there anything to eat?
My faith is shaken, I can see through your lies! You are a fraud and I must tell the others!
Great Leader, I am tired of sleeping outside on the ground. There are bugs and my back aches. Would you build me somewhere to rest?
All this mess made me sick! If you don't allow me to rest then I'll surely die!
Yuuuck, this place is gross! If you don't clean this up, someone will get sick!
Leader, if we want to survive here we're going to need to start farming some food.
Forgive my forwardness, Leader, but if we want to advance we need to start refining our resources!
Great Leader! The Cult is growing by the day... it is time you gave it a name!
... that has a nice ring to it!
Leader! I have returned safe from my missionary, and have brought an offering.
I have returned from my successful missionary bearing gifts!
I did it, Leader! I have retrieved what you were after from my missionary.
I managed to find 
 whilst on my mission.
Leader... I was badly injured during my missionary. I can die in peace, knowing I got to speak with you one last time.
I am so sorry, Leader... I failed my mission. I can only hope you'll remember me well.
I was not strong enough... I just couldn't do it... I'm so sorry, Leader.
I am not known for my patience. Return to me when you have what I need.
Don't have that.
You don't have it? Then I 
strongly
 suggest you go and 
get it. 
When you have what I desire, seek me here. You will only find me in the darkness.
Yes
No
A little Lamb, all alone… careful. You never know what lurks in the night.
And yet I smell no fear on you. How 
curious.
Ah. I see. You wear the 
Red Crown.
 I knew your predecessor. He was a weak and cowering thing.
Not like you, I should think.
Little Lamb, you’ve made a deal before. How about another? Fear not, I won’t ask for anything as valuable as your 
eternal servitude.
I’m hungry. Starving. 
ravenous.
I want a fish. A big fish. And I will give you something in return. Do you accept?
Clever creature. Take this and look away, won’t you? I’m afraid I’m a bit of a 
messy eater.
You will not see me here again, but our paths will cross elsewhere. In moments of chance, in the cover of night.
No? I shouldn't be surprised. Just a little Lamb after all...
Seek me out in the dark, should you change your mind. It will be worth your while...
Little Lamb. We meet again. A beautiful night, is it not?
Does your Cult flourish?
Are they devoted? Are they strong?
Well, you know what they say. The best thing a Follower can do… is follow.
Say, how about another deal? I’m afraid the hunting tonight is sparse. Too many predators, not enough prey.
If you give to me one of your loyal Followers, I will give you something in return. Do you agree?
Another… satisfying deal. Here, take this. Now do excuse me - I’m 
famished.
Hmm. Perhaps you are not the Leader I thought you to be.
Seek me out once should you change your mind. I'll be waiting...
Little Lamb! Your kind are not usually so fond of the dark, but I suppose you are unlike the rest. How fare your Followers?
Do they love you? Do they fear you?
The nights are getting longer. The monsters grow more fierce. Tell me, how does another deal sound? I promise to make it worth your while.
I have something of great value. Something that is one of a kind. No matter how hard you look, you will not find this item again.
And all I want in return is… well, it’s nothing really. Nothing at all.
A simple choice - two measly Followers. Or if that causes you unease, then how about… half of a heart from the great Leader themselves? A fair equivalent, I think.
Come now, a great Leader must make sacrifices. Two pathetic little Followers, or a pound of your own flesh?
You disappoint me, Lamb. I thought better of you.
After all, a life pledged to you is yours to do with what you wish.
You are a pragmatic sort. That’s what I enjoy about you, little Lamb.
Here, as promised. Now I must take my leave... I have 
dinner plans.
Little Laaaaaaaaaamb!
Do you feel it? We stand at a crossroads. And this will be the last time we meet - so the darkness has decreed.
One last deal.
I will give you something more coveted than anything else in this world or the next. Something folks have fought for, killed for, lost their minds for - and it will be yours.
In exchange I want only one thing:
Ratau.
The rat is old, and of no use to you or anyone else. Give Ratau’s death meaning...
Give Ratau’s death to me. What say you?
I have come to like you, Little Lamb. So I shall not take your refusal for the insult that it is.
I will give you a chance to reconsider. In time, you shall realise that I am right.
Should you change your mind, you know where I will be.
Ha.
Hahahaha
hahahahahaha
hahahahahahahahahaha
Little Lamb!
Truly, a beast after my own heart! While we may seem like different breeds, we are brethren to the bone.
And as our bargain has been struck, allow me to make fair return. I give you this:
The gift of clarity.
You know exactly the kind of creature you are.
You should count yourself lucky. Many go their whole miserable lives without ever gleaning such a divine truth.
Farewell, Little Lamb. I never thought to meet another like me in this life, and you have proven me wrong. May your kills keep you fed as they have me, and may the Night hold you close.
Sacrifice Follower
Ignore
Good choice! Here, take this.
What a shame...
You have no Followers to sacrifice, my friend.
Hey, you! I've heard of you and your Cult.
Have you got a spare Follower? Sacrifice one here for me, it'll be worth it.
Oh look, it's you again!
What do you think - sacrifice a Follower for me?
You're back again?
I'm sure you've got plenty of Followers. Too many, even! May as well let one go.
You know how it goes...
It's time to sacrifice a Follower for me!
O Great Leader in Light… what do you know about Tarot Cards?
I cannot use them myself, but I find them often when walking by the sea.
Even though they are half-drowned or buried in sand, they do not tear or warp. Isn’t that odd?
Some say the cards reveal fate… I say the cards are 
 each. Interested?
What do the cards have in store today?
Oops, I meant what cards do we have in store today!
May the cards be kind...
May the Light be your guide.
Looks like you don't have enough 
gold.
 Sorry Leader, business is business.
I had a lover once who went to sea and never came back. They used to lay flowers by my door.
Flowers suit the young and beautiful best. They've no place with me.
Please, buy them, they bring only sadness now.
I wonder what became of them...
Such sad memories...
...come back with 
gold.
 guide us mighty light
 bring forth light
 forgive us light 
 show yourself light
 guide us mighty lamb!
 the lamb brought forth the light
 forgive our sins lamb of light! 
 we pledge ourselves to you oh lamb of light!
WHAAA! Who dares enter our sacred house of light!?
Apologies… it’s just that the lighthouse is getting dimmer no matter how hard we worship, and the ships keep sinking on the rocks.
No ships means no new pilgrims to walk the sacred path!
If only our leader was here - she would know what to do! We have not seen her since she went for a walk on the pier late one night.
We begged her not to go, we all know of the 
'Teeth in the Darkness.'
 But she would not listen...
Now we have no choice but to pray until the lighthouse is lit once more! 
all hail the mighty light!
gasp!
 Our prayers have been answered!
Thank you, O Bright One, for sending this Lamb to save us! Now the pilgrims will return to our shores!
For restoring the Light, we 
pledge ourselves
 to you! We are your unworthy servants, 
mighty lamb!
We will pray to you and your great Light on this shrine! Please, bathe in our adoration!
Come one, come all, to a palace of wonder and delight!
Where all that glimmers is gold - guaranteed!
Midas's Cave
 open seven days!
Welcome! Welcome! Look everyone, we have a visitor!
Oh, stop laughing! Our guest may not look like much, but Fortune favours the gold... I mean bold!
My dear new friend, Midas's Cave serves a certain class of clientele. If you can meet those standards, welcome! If not...
Please, look around. You are my guest here. I will leave you to peruse. Should you have any questions, Midas is here to help!
Now I'm sure great Leaders such as yourself get plenty of Devotion from your Followers for free. But surely a visionary like you could always use... more?
We can offer you our Devotion 
 for a 
great price!
The price goes 
up
 the more you want it, and 
down
 the longer you leave it.
The question, really, is how long can you resist?
This is where we trust our precious Gold to the Gods. Sometimes in their benevolence they give back 
more.
 Other times, it is 
lost.
But it is not for us mere mortals to question… present company excluded, of course.
But for the use of such a service, the organisation would require a... let's call it a donation. For someone of your talents, shall we say 
Oh, you are most generous! I would have taken half that amount. You really don't know how to negotiate, do you?
The well is at your disposal, make as much use of it as you will. 
May Fortune be kind! 
Ah, now this is very special! This is where 
improvements
 are made.
Improvements? Why, yes! For what is the one thing that is more valuable than life itself? Why, 
gold
 of course!
You wear a crown, you must have Followers who would be... shall we say, worth their weight in gold?
Come now, don't be 
greedy!
 I'd make it 
worth your while.
Wonderful! Wonderful! Yes, much better!
Now, in exchange you may have this - I've tried to melt it down but it stubbornly refuses to be turned into something 
useful.
I'm sure someone of your position would find value in it. It's yours!
Another addition to my gallery - how wonderful!
I have a few more of these, if you are willing to help me grow my collection.
Oh, this one has turned out particularly well!
This has become a most agreeable arrangement!
Magnificent! Bravo! 
bravo!
Sadly, this is the last piece I have. Thank you for helping me to grow my little collection here.
You are indeed a most generous and gracious Lamb.
You poor, tired Lamb. It must be hard work, shepherding your flock, seeing to their needs in return for their loyalty. But here, things are not so complicated.
Those who say Devotion can't be bought clearly weren't offering enough! You are welcome to it... so long as you can afford it.
You have done well, Lamb.
You have built a Cult to strengthen me with their Faith. You sent to me the Bishops, and I have broken them and their chains alike.
Vessel, I relinquish you from your service to the Red Crown. Return it to me, and embrace the end that awaits. With this last sacrifice of my most devoted Follower, I will be freed.
Finally... I will be 
free!
Let us observe ceremony. My devoted Followers I summon, to bear witness to my rising.
Approach, vessel, and lay your life down at my feet.
Leader! What are you doing!?
silence!
 What blasphemy is this!? I am the God of this Cult! You will bow to me, and me alone!
The Lamb has provided us food, shelter, guidance - they are our true Leader. We don't even know you!
So you have betrayed me, Lamb. You have shunned my gospel, and claimed yourself a false idol.
That crown is mine by divine right!
 You think to stand in the very face of death?
Master! Allow me. I will give this wretch a taste of your wrath.
I will take care of this beast, master. I will cut that crown from its 
head!
You think yourself victorious? You think yourself safe? Do not forget 
you belong to me.
All you have done is ensure your own suffering, and the suffering of your wretched Cult. And oh, how you will all 
suffer.
Even after I have slaughtered you, your pain will not end. 
You cannot escape me, even in death.
Did you believe me defeated? Did you think that to be all there was to a being such as I?
You thought yourself above a 
god?
Nothing is beyond my grasp. Nothing can escape me. I am 
The One Who Waits.
You are corrupt, false idol. Your corruption has no doubt spread.
I will simply have to 
cull you all.
N-no! This is impossible! One such as I cannot be killed! There must 
always
 be a God in the Lands of the Old Faith.
You have supplanted me. A vessel no more, instead a crown bearing deity. Damned Lamb!
I am at your mercy, are you to be a vengeful false idol, or merciful coward? No longer can you blame your vile acts on me.
You weak, snivelling, foul thing. You - wait! 
Waaaiiiiiiit!
So, you are no different to me after all. You have become as I am.
My love took my heart to the sea, the sea, she took my heart to the sea...
'Tis where my heart will be, will be, in her bed at the bottom of the sea
Welcome crusader, take a moment to join me in my search. I look for the heart that once beat in my chest. That is until it was taken by... her.
I have been sitting here for so many years, even her face has faded from my mind, yet I keep searching. Always searching.
I've a dozen hearts you see, but none of them are mine. They are yours if you wish to have them, crusader.
They are worthless to me. I care only for the heart that was once mine... so that I might look upon her face one last time... 
sigh.
I need only find it and I will see her again. I have waited here for so long and all I want is but a moment together once more.
A moment of respite in the eye of the storm!
I'll trawl the depths, for the heart she took from my chest!
Crusader you have come to join me! I am glad for the company, for this can be such a lonely place.
Help! Get me out of here please!
Finally... let us end this.
I'll be awaiting you in my temple... come! Witness 
true
 power.
You did it, didn't you? You tasted the power of the 
mushrooms
... yes, you are just like 
Sozo.
Sozo
 knows you are a friend!
Here, you must take this. A sign of friendship between two lovers of the 
Menticide Mushroom.
 Keep it safe! You can trust no one... 
no one!
Sozo
 supposes you want something for your efforts? Of course! 
Sozo
 always pays his debts. Take this.
What a lovely heart! A shame it isn't mine.
More hearts! And yet, my chest is empty.
I know that rhythm! The sturdy beat of that heart, it could only be mine!
Wayward heart, returned at last!
 Crusader, the hollow of my chest yearns for a reunion. May I?
Okay
No
Ah. Perhaps I was mistaken... it's been a long time, see, since I've felt a drumming in my chest. Wishful thinking, I suppose...
Oh! Oh! I am happy and I am sad, I weep and I laugh, and I love! Thank you, crusader, for what you have done.
Spare
Consume
Greetings, traveller. I am a servant of the Crown, much like yourself.
I will journey these lands carrying found treasures back to your base for you.
All I ask is a humble donation for my time.
Great Leader, we can’t rely on your crusades to bring us 
 and 
, let us build a 
Lumber Yard
 and 
Stone Mine
 so through our sweat and toil you may grow rich in these resources
The Bishops… my family. Have they not suffered enough? Have I not suffered
enough?
We fought, pathetic vessel. We bled. We grieved. And yet the Red Crown wants more.
No more.
Pathetic, sniveling, vile puppet to the Red Crown.
You will not succeed.
We are far older and more powerful than a creature like you could ever conceive.
I will not suffer the same fate as 
him
After everything we did. Everything we sacrificed. He will not be satiated.
I may be the youngest of the Bishops, Little Lamb, but I am strong. 
And you are in my woods.
i will destroy you.
The Crown… his power… could it be?
But I am stronger still. Turn tail and run, Little Lamb.
This is not a 
safe place
 for one such as 
you.
 Flee like the prey you are, if you wish to survive.
Did you hear? Leshy was slaughtered! Never liked him, anyway.
Heket has been killed! Anura has no God.
Someone just told me that Kallamar has died! He begged for mercy, but was struck down by a vengeful God. A new God…
Shamura has died. It was probably for the best. They were always a bit… you know.
One of the Bishops of the Old Faith, dead! I didn’t think it was possible…
Have you heard of the wrathful spirit striking down the Bishops? With glowing red eyes, vicious claws, and a thirst for blood… they say there’s a new God in the Lands of the Old Faith…
Praise the Lamb! Praise the Lamb!
The lighthouse at Pilgrim’s Passage is lit once more! Things seem to be changing around here…
I got lost in Anura and was so hungry I ate some mushrooms I found. Woke up three days later with the worst headache. But I kind of want more…
I visited Midas’s cave to look at his collection of statues. As I was walking through, I thought I heard one of them whispering. But that’s impossible, right? They’re just statues!
O what good are hearts if they cannot be given?
I thought to keep mine to myself, once. Two kits I did have, true love found!
And yet one lackadaisy summer day, my beautiful children were taken away… a gift, they said, for the one they loved most, the one that waits… I wept, I keened…
But how can one say no to a God?
Wherever they be, I hope they are as devoted and loving as I!
Ah! I remember! That Crown, my brother had one just like it.
Do you know him? Ratau? Is he well? It’s been an age since we last met - I’m a busy rat!
Well, say hello for me, won’t you?
Here lies 
Jimpian
Given to the Teeth in the Darkness.
I am sorry, friend. I wish I had chosen differently 
 - r.
Here Godly blood was spilled.
Here did Death no longer wish to wait.
…in blood, bone and flesh… beast nameless and blessed…
…in sacrifice… rest…
…bottom dweller he was, muck eating prey…
…sparkling gold one day found amongst the dregs, lost by a pirate with many legs…
…pretty shiny prize for all……they all want… they all want…
…they all want… nothing remains… blood washes away in the tide…
…he waits, waits and then takes… even muck eaters have teeth…
…there is no help for me now…
Eons agone, these lands were rife with Gods and their adherents.
What befell this pantheon? Alas. ‘Tis the nature of beasts to forget, and of Gods to be forgotten.
Mayhap they left. Mayhap they slept. Mayhap they devoured and were devoured in turn. Those few who remained spread roots, spun webs, molded this world to meet them and theirs.
‘Twere a land of many Gods, once. Hundreds. Now…
Hello, old friend. Remember me?
It’s you! No, wait! Lamb, don’t trust this murderer-
Winds of change blow; dost thou sense it? Around us, the world creaks and turns. Afore, it stood immobile. Motionless centuries grow rust.
Now, 
Leshy
 hath fallen, and hereupon the inhabitants of this land begin their fight anew to presume power. Ye shall not find them so easily dispatched again.
Another Bishop struck down; 
Heket
 ruled an aeon, afeard by none.
Her dominion being of famine, her peons, now freed, are ravenous in their appetites. Tread warily, lest thou be predated upon.
Although a renowned recreant amongst his peerage, 
Kallamar
 was masterful in the repression of his underlings through ague.
Freed of plague, the creatures of 
Anchordeep
 strike with renewed vigor. Heed caution, as thou travel therewith.
Shamura
, now smited. Since time immemorial has their presence weighed heavy upon the beasts within.
Their worshippers doth be well versed in the art of war-making. Prithee, move with care. Sharp teeth doth not equate to quick death.
A God slain; another God risen from his blood. Hail the Lamb.
No longer art thou constrained to this mortal plane. Fare beyond this corporeal world, Godly beast.
The gateway hence will allow thine to crusade yonder. Enter hither, and remain as long as thine wish… or 
survive.
Rewards yet to be found, and otherworldly creatures yet to slay. Be merry Lamb - thine gospel is yet to be written!
The Temple is the centre of your Cult. From there you will preach 
Sermons
 to grow 
stronger
 and perform 
Rituals
 to 
mould
 the fragile minds of your Followers.
You are responsible for maintaining the 
Faith
 of your Cult. If it falls too low, your Followers will 
dissent
 against you and eventually leave.
To keep their 
Faith
 high there are a number of things you can do. Provide for their needs, preach 
Sermons
, perform 
Rituals
 and build 
structures
 to inspire them
Now is your chance to prove that you are the leader you need to be. Raise the 
Faith
 of your Cult.
If you are to guide your Cult you will need to declare 
Doctrines
 so that they might obey you.
Return to the lands of the 
Old Faith
 and seek out 
Commandment Stone fragments.
 With these you will be able to declare new Doctrines.
I feel my bones creaking, and my sight fading. Yet my heart sings knowing that I have spent my life in your service, oh Mighty Lamb!
Entering the lands of the Bishop 
. Those who do not follow the ways of the 
Old Faith
 will be 
destroyed.
The worm, it is hungry. It feeds. It partakes of our flesh. But that is the price for safety. For that we gladly give it all we have.
Rare decorations, all found by our great leader - the glorious 
Sozo!
We sell them to raise money for mushrooms. 
More mushrooms!
 We must always have 
more!
You have gotten further than most, granted.
Step forward, beast, from the swirling mists of chaos that surround. Allow me to regard you wholly.
Hmm. You carry the weight of ageless centuries upon such diminutive shoulders.
Yet, what is this? It seems your stature is deceiving.
A weapon is naught without the hand that wields. To fell enemies, to defend honour... to break chains.
Let your Crown take the form of one of these works of iron, forged in everlasting fire.
May you wield them well, Promised Liberator.
You have your Followers, and I my weapons. One must find comfort and power where they can.
I speak to my weapons often, though I dare not argue. Only a fool bickers with a sharp blade.
When reason is extinguished there is but one recourse. That is why I must keep the flames of my forge burning.
The fires of my forge I have kept alight since the first dawn. Only the final setting of the sun will see it doused.
Forged in eternal flame, sharpened on the stone wet with blood. They seek destruction as their nature demands. Can the same be said of yourself?
Hello! You have so many mouths to feed! 
You must need some seeds.
A Cult leader is always good for business. So many hungry Followers with growling tummies!
I'll just set up here, and if you're in need of crops... you know where I am! You don't mind, do you?
Yesss, I can smell tasty critters near... mmm...
I stays here, there's enough for you and enough for me.
Don't let your Followers wander away... you never know who might be nearby and hungry!
That fellow outside! The fisherman. There’s something off about him… It’s almost as if he were a- No, that would be too ridiculous.
O Lamb of the Light! May I beseech you once more for your aid?
The Lighthouse is in disrepair... we need to replace the crystals that reflect the light out to sea.
Would you... could you... find such material for us? We know not where to look, but should you succeed we will give you an offering in return!
Gracious Lamb! You have once more restored this place to all its shining glory.
As I swore, here is our offering in return. PRAISE THE LAMB! O LAMB OF LIGHT!
Who is 
Sozo
 talking to when he whispers in the dark...?
Once you taste the Menticide Mushroom your mind will be opened.
Sozo
 grows cruel and unpredictable... I fear for our fate here!
Sozo
 is so happy! 
Sozo
 has never had so many 
mushrooms
 before.
If it wasn't for you, 
Sozo
 would never be able to get so many at once!
Sozo
 cannot wait to see what happens!
Okay, that's it! Now you must 
die!
Okay! Okay! You have bested me.
My love's honor goes unavenged! You heartless villain.
Just don't hurt us anymore, and in return I will continue to do business with you!
Praise you mighty Lamb! You have performed a miracle on this day!
Hallelujah the Lamb has slain a non-believer!
We throw ourselves at your feet! You truly are the anointed one!
That... was... 
awesome!!
You were all like 'swoosh!' 'Bang!' 'Boosh!' And they were all like 'argghh! Aww noo!'
You are the best. We love you!
Help! Get me out of here please!
We refused to convert so 
they
 killed everyone. Please, take me with you.
They took my family and sacrificed them to 
. Now I'm all alone.
The followers of 
 burned down our village! Please... I have nowhere to go!
We fought them off as best we could, I'm the only one that survived. 
 was once a a safe place.
Oh, darkness! Oh suffering!
What say you lamb? Do you embrace the cruelties of this world?
Life is misery.
Life is beautiful.
May I join you? May we swim in the misery of our minds, together?
To see grace in a land such as this... I cannot be around such delirium.
A cold wind blows, the dead are near. I hear them whispering. Perform a 
Blood Moon Ritual
 so we might see their restless spirits.
The presence of 
 has been reborn stronger and awaits...
The presence of 
 has been weakened...
I seek the newly anointed God, successor of their victims, last of their kind. Confer with me.
Fickle beast, do you not feel how the boundary betwixt this world and the next has begun to fray?
You are artless in your duties, Infant God. You bestow upon the Bishops death, yet deny them rest.
Bearer of the Red Crown, set this right. Forced are they to relive their final agonies; move them on, as is your duty as the new 
God of Death.
Crusade once more. Give peace the Bishops trapped between life and death.
I sense your success. I feel... I feel the presence of a 
God Tear 
Strength, longevity, and a mourning that stretches eternally. Found in the bellies of the foulest of 
beasts
 and 
villains.
 But seen only by those ascended to 
Godhood.
I am glad to have underestimated you. For I deal 
only with Gods.
An offer, newly ascended; give unto me a name, and we shall be fellows in enterprise. I have precious articles for a being such as you.
And thus, our contract is struck. Bring me the 
God Tears 
 and I shall reward you in turn.
Tell me, Godly one, do you crave 
more?
Of course you do. For what God is satisfied with what merely 
is
As you have seen with the Bishops, there is a state that exists betwixt the layers of this world. 
Purgatory,
 some may call it.
Enter once daily, whilst mortal time stagnates. The blasphemous souls of 
Purgatory
 may be expiated for as long as you wish... or survive. Time will stand still in this world, your Followers will need nothing of you while you venture there.
And should more God Tears find their way to you… well. 
 awaits.
One can be certain of nothing but the heart’s-
Oh.
A heart remembers. A mother shan’t forget.
O, generous fortune! Should I be dreaming, never allow me to wake! Kit, fraction of my beating heart!
Ah, Lamb! Praised Lamb! Blessed Lamb! My son returned, soul almost whole.
Kindly deeds for kindly rewards! Take this, and I shall insist.
Should my other son cross thy path, pass unto him that a mother loves, misses, understands!
Often I would hope, and scorned myself foolish, that upon the opening of mine eyes, my kits would return.
When they did not, I would dream instead of their smiling faces held close by kindly paws! O with all my humble heart did I yearn for such!
And here, now… ah! The wounds of a heart once carved may yet be healed!
Blessed Lamb, the heart remains an infinite vessel. And yet mine overflows.
Blessed Lamb, what language speaks love? What of gratitude? Whichever it is, mine is due to you!
My kits? O, the soul of a wanderer for one, and a warrior the other!
Miss them, I always shall! But to love them I am gratefully bound.
They will follow their hearts, and I am only glad!
Back! Stay back! I will slice your belly open! I will cut that Crown from your head!
What foul place is this? Moments ago I was… I was…
Master! Aym? What is this place?
So much colour… so many creatures…
…master?
Ah. Ah! The Red Crown. And you, beast… Godly.
Come. I have tools to give, yes? Crafted by 
Chemach.
 My brothers, they might have pretty things, but mine? Power. Powerful things.
Will you look? Will you take? What will you give in turn? Your flesh? Your bone? Your Crown?
Ah! Ah! I jest, I joke! I won’t take anything! Nothing for 
Chemach!
Crowned Lamb, take this. And if my brothers are out there… they will deal soon to 
Chemach.
 Ha!
Sister 
Chemach's
 madness was foreseen in the first turn of the cards, drawn by her own kin. As I have always done.
Is destiny the grail which must be pursued? Or the force which drives one onward?
Come. Let us draw once more.
The first card, a beacon. The second, a shadow. The third, something lost, or perchance taken. Card inverted, it must be sought.
The cards speak. A relic calls. Yours to seek and to claim.
Your relic, beast. I see 
Chemach
 sustains herself still, though creation begets destruction. As nature demands.
Hatched were we, in the bosom of the last of the First Gods. To bestow Godly instruments, and yet never wield them ourselves. As nature demands.
Some place, I feel darkness. Something of me, now in the belly of some great beastie, and through their bones, laughter…
 Seek this Relic, in this place.
Infant God! You think yourself worthy of my realm?
Do not act the fool. A God may not be foolish.
Well met, Infant God.
Tears of the First Gods… for what were they mourning?
Their use is yours to dictate. I am merely a merchant to the eternal.
Do not think to cheat me, Infant God.
This pact binds us both. Return with God Tears or do not return.
Hmf. Aym and Baal? I did not take them. They were given.
Intended as keepers, perhaps, but they were young and in need of guidance. Must I be blamed for my influence?
Salvaged from the void, they are yours now. Do what you wish, scornful God. I care not for them.
Ooh, kits… I remember, I remember… two kits in my claws… a gift…
I did not want him to be… lonely…
Time to put an end to this… frivolous masquerade… time to put an end…
End… this… 
Vile, sniveling puppet… I will destroy you again… and again…
Stay back! Stay away! Mercy, Red Crown, mercy…
I will fight your ceaseless war. In this way shall 
Purgatory
 draw semblance to life.
I will fight your ceaseless war. In this way shall I be punished.
…what? Where am I? What is this darkness?
I… I cannot see! 
Where is my Crown!?
Lamb! Damned Lamb! I know you are there, I 
smell
 you.
What… has become of us?
…….feed me.........
Mercy! Mercy, spare me! Lamb, I beg you, spare me-
What is this? Shamura, Heket? Leshy? I feel… 
bleugh.
I was having a dream, Lamb, that we fought. Over and over we fought. And I… died. Or I did not live.
I could not rest. I have known all but I have not known this…
Where am I? Who… are we?
Spin my web, I catch my prey… spin my web, day by day… in the night… I hear them pray… mercy is not my name…
ah ah ah ah ah!
 Lambchop, ye won’t believe it!
These blasted Witnesses have returned! I swear, didn’t ye… take care of ‘em?
Well, they’re back! What a world, eh? If only the dead would stay that way!
Get ‘em gone, won’t ye? I’ve dug up some good pieces for ye, too!
Knew ye had it in ye! I’m a Plimbo of me word - here ye go!
Ahhh, these Eyes fetch a good price in certain circles… here’s your cut!
Ain’t that a sight for sore eyes… get it? Ah ah ah!
Ye are a damned blessing, Lamb. Let’s hope this time they stay down, eh?
Braise the Lamb and all that! Is that how it goes? 
Ah ah ah!
So thou art the creature causing the ether of this world to ripple and warp.
It has been an age since I have made the acquaintance of a new sort of idol.
Continue in this fashion, and we shall meet again hence. If not, be thankful for our meeting now.
I know that smell. The red flowers… blooming eternally, even when I was merely a burrower.
Through the dirt I would wade until one day… I found a Crown… or perhaps it found me?
…go away, Lamb!
Lamb
You 
dare
Ah! An offering to me? You have sense, Lamb.
Yes, mine was the most beautiful temple. Shamura’s had a certain eeriness, and Leshy too, but Heket… eugh.
Yes, I will keep this.
Ahhhhhh. Yes, yes, hello.
Many-legged creature, stalk through night… wrapped in web, yet still they fight…
In my silk, I snared a Crown… to their faith, irrevocably bound…
Lamb… this is not a favour. I do not need your charity!
But when dear brother 
Narinder
 struck us in his fury, my eyes were torn from the socket.
One was salvaged, and hidden in the tangled 
Darkwood.
 I despair at the thought of it being uncovered by some simple-minded beast.
You have navigated my realm once before. Do so again, and recover my eye. Perhaps we can make an arrangement.
……Lamb…….
Anura…….hides………what I……………
lost
......yours...........for........now..................
Lamb! I recalled, as I sat here, a place in the unknowable fathoms of Anchordeep.
I sunk it there, my handsome ear, unfairly taken by Narinder. Fetch it, won’t you?
I wrapped a precious thing in web and nestled it deep in the bosom of the Silk Cradle…
…but where? When? And 
what
Ohoho! Hello there, valued client. My, such tatty clothing! It’s been an age since I've left home, but I was compelled.\x20
What a rich world! Sinister and vibrant and 
rich!
 And isn't charity the greatest virtue?
Esteemed patron, what a small world! Fancy seeing you again. What is that smell? Do you never wash? Ohoho!
Take care not to get lost. Things seem to get lost around here all the time… so easy to misplace one's 
Gold!
Cherished customer, what are the chances we’d run into each other again? I do admire how you don't care for appearances. Ohoho!\x20
I, on the other hand, am respectable, elegant, and at all times beautiful! Now I'll just take care of some business....
Ah! Stop that!
Eek! Ouchie! Ow!
Hail, Lamb. ‘Tis a world of flux in which we once more meet.
Tis a motion behind which thou art the force. Yet thy reign is in its cradle, thy duties not yet satisfied. Lamb, thy know what must be done.
I mean not to affright, though certainly Gods may fear. Thou have proven such. Attend thy tasks. Triumph. Hail, Lamb.
Thou have caught me amidst contemplation, Lamb.
The First Gods… formidable though they were, humbly didst they relinquish existence.\x20
Mayhap they perceived themselves upon the precipice of some great change, one they would not outlive.
A precipice upon which we now teeter, nay?
‘Twere a land of many Gods, once. Hundreds.
Sooth, ‘tis not known how many hath risen and perished since the First.
Slain, purged, or simply… forgotten. A Crown’s eye closed in slumber… or perchance in waiting.
The Bishops Four now placated, what great power hath lain dormant in anticipation of this very moment?
ah ah ah ah!
 Hello, me mighty Lamb!
I tell ye, things have really changed! Monsters be tougher, ‘tis true, and the heavens themselves quake. BUT-
The booty! 
Oooooh, the booty.
Lamby! What a night for a wander! The air seems different…
Bop and me, we were just taking a break from dice for the night. We’ll head back to Ratau’s soon.
He’s a good rat, Ratau! Took me and Bop in when we had nowhere to go. That’s why he was a great Leader! Loved by all.
You are too, of course!
Whistle, whistle!
Hello, kid! Me? I’m just a man, out for a walk, like men like to do.
Heard that the world was changing, I had to see for meself!
Whistle, whistle!
Haha, yeah! I can’t whistle. It's me fish lips... man lips! I meant man lips!
Mushrooms, where are you? I hear you call to Sozo…
Ah, mushroom! Mushroom the size of a lamb! Mushroom, remember when you met Sozo?
Sozo had friends... Followers... family... now Sozo has 
mushrooms...
This is better! Is this better? Ha! Hahahaha! Ha...
Ah! It’s you! Please don’t hurt us!
We used to follow Mad Sozo, but he… well… have you seen him lately? I suggest you visit him to learn of his fate...
Ah! What a hideous creature!
That’s very rude.
Ah! It can talk!
It’s you. Usurper of the Red Crown. The one who freed us.
Ha! You are nothing compared to our Master. We have not been in this world long, but already I can tell you are weak.
You lack discipline. Our Master wielded Death with precision and control. You allow chaos to reign.
What my brother means to say is thank you.
Little Lamb, I feel you there… Darkwood has not forgotten me yet…
I can still… find you… 
in my woods…
Foul beast! You dare trap me thus?
If you insist I suffer, so shall you.
Free me! Let me 
out!
Bond forged by the spilling of blood… I know you hear me, God of Death.
Ignoble Lamb… 
finish what you’ve begun…
Ah! Ah! My Followers! Chemach’s Followers!
You attack Chemach’s following!? Chemach’s following will attack you!
Little God, do not provoke the mighty Chemach!
Little God likes Chemach’s Followers? Chemach made them herself!
Once of Gods, now Godly power contained… eyes and ears and throats and brains…
Ah. Ah! Chemach can make Relic from anything. Hairs and nails, little Lamb tails…
Do you like my Crown? Made by Chemach. Out of what? Hehehehe…
Ah! Ah! My pretty creations! Holy pieces of revered beings...
They hunger, yes? Crave the power that was once theirs, yes?
Feed them, yes? They are hungry, hungry for miscreant flesh... 
let them feast...
Ah! Yes! Better than silly card, better than pointy sword, 
Chemach is better.
Little God will come again! Chemach will give Relic. Chemach will make Relic. 
Chemach will make Relic out of you one day.
Bye bye!
A draw! The most exciting outcome in a game of Knucklebones. Well done, Lamb!
A draw in Knucklebonesssss? Well, colour me surprisssed!
Well, look at that, wee Lamb! It’s a draw! No one wins. Or everyone wins!
What!? A draw? Hmf. Again!
I recall Leshy. Prior to yourself, he was the last to bargain with me.
Adept as he was, he rose quickly to the challenges of Godhood, aided by his siblings. Many were drawn to his chaotic ways.
I am not inclined to emotion, the way your kind are. Though if I were, Heket would certainly inspire amusement.
She was perhaps the most vicious of them. Wicked beast.
It did not matter to Kallamar that his ears were lost, for he was never inclined to listen.
Foolish though he may have seemed, he wielded the power of his Crown without discrimination.
Shamura and I did not barter much. In truth, they needed little from me.
Truly, ‘twas a shame what became of them.
So you have completed your task, Red Crown. The Bishops are trapped no longer. What becomes of them now is not of my interest. Though what becomes of yourself…
Many a deity have I bartered with, their designs ones I have seen repeated through the millennia. Your designs, however… very interesting.
As such, I offer you a boon; a cementing of our new undertaking.
This shrine is carved in the likeness of a God with whom I once bargained. May it remind you of the role which you must now fill.
A toy for you. Benefactor, comrade, malignant foe… redemption or punishment, ‘tis yours to confer as you see fit.
Infant God, by your influence this Land is changing, ‘tis true.The laws of this world, and even of the next, have become malleable.
Yet the ether, having flowed in one fashion for many an age, shall not be diverted so easily. That which seems still, runs deep.
There is much yet to uncover. God Tears remain. Do not allow complacency to take root.
Yet you have shown yourself to be a worthy deity. Take your rightful place amongst the pantheon as you have earned. All hail the Lamb, all hail the God of Death!
What is this? Lamb!
You have brought me here to continue my eternal punishment? Revel in my shame? Damned Lamb!
Bah! The world, it shakes! Here is as dangerous as anywhere!
Make it worth my while for me to stay. My 
delicious wares
 are now double the price!
Scary round head… too scary to eat…
My tasty treaties will have to be twice as much gold! I do not like the round head…
Entering the lands of the Bishop 
. Those who do not follow the ways of the Old Faith will be destroyed.
praise the lamb
Our inaugural transaction. Some items may hold powers you cannot yet fathom. May they serve you well.
I know that smell. The red flowers… blooming eternally, even when I was merely a burrower.
Through the dirt I would wade until one day… I found a Crown… or perhaps it found me?
…go away, Lamb!
Lamb
You 
dare
Ah! An offering to me? You have sense, Lamb.
Yes, mine was the most beautiful temple. Shamura’s had a certain eeriness, and Leshy too, but Heket… eugh.
Yes, I will keep this.
Ahhhhhh. Yes, yes, hello.
Many-legged creature, stalk through night… wrapped in web, yet still they fight…
In my silk, I snared a Crown… to their faith, irrevocably bound…
Awake Lamb! If you seek penitence, you've found it. But know that in this realm, 
mortal
 needs must be met.
You will now need to 
eat
 and 
sleep
 in order to survive. To sleep, seek a bed to rest your head.
When eating, your meals must be 
cooked
 - it's not enough to simply eat ingredients!
Your 
hunger
 and
exhaustion
 will have to be managed even while Crusading. If either lead to your demise, death will be 
permanent.
To avoid such a fate, use your 
Omnipresence ability
 to be instantly transported back to the Cult.
Now, 
penitence awaits!
 A gift from me to you - you do need a 
shrine
, after all...
Follower Loyalty
Increase a Follower's 
Loyalty
 and they will eventually give you a large reward.
To increase their Loyalty, you can give a Follower a 
blessing
 once a day when you interact with them.
You can also give them 
gifts
 and complete the 
quests
 they ask you to do.
Once completely 
loyal,
 a Follower will grant you a large reward.
Cult Surveillance
The 
Surveillance Tower
 allows you to learn every little secret your Followers may be hiding.
Interact with the 
Surveillance Tower
 to see an overview of the Cult as a whole.
You can now interact with Followers to 
read their thoughts,
 as well as see how hungry, tired or sick they are.
Faith
Your Cult has a 
Faith level
 which is affected by your actions as leader, and whether or not your Followers are being well cared for. To keep it high, perform 
Rituals
, preach 
Sermons
, cook 
food
 and build 
shelters
 for them.
You can see the 
Faith
 of your Cult at the top left of the screen.
Follower's productivity is tied to Faith. When it is high they will 
work
 harder and generate 
Devotion
 more quickly.
When your Cult's Faith becomes too low, Followers may 
dissent
 and try to convince others to turn against you as well.
Healing Bay
When assigned 
bed rest, 
sick Followers may visit an available 
Healing Bay
 to heal much faster than they otherwise would.
Place
 flowers
 at the Healing Bay for Followers to heal considerably faster.
Poop, vomit and dead bodies cause illness to spread quickly throughout your Cult.
Cleaning messes and burying bodies will prevent the spread of illness.
Rituals
Performing 
Rituals
 in the Temple is the quickest way to become more powerful and solve problems in your Cult.
Perform 
Faith of the Flock
 to permanently gain more 
hearts,
and unlock devastating new 
Curses
 and 
Weapons
Unlock other Rituals by performing Sermons. Each Ritual will cost 
 from fallen enemies.
Indoctrinate more Followers to unlock the 
Faith of the Flock
 ritual.
Rituals also require 
 from defeated bosses and 
 from fallen enemies.
Consecrating Resources
More advanced structures require 
Consecrated Resources. 
Consecrated resources are made up of base resources.
Unlock and build a 
Refinery
 to be able to consecrate resources.
Queue up an order at the Refinery and a 
Follower
 will automatically come to consecrate the resources for you.
Dissenter
A Follower has begun 
Dissenting
 against you. This happens when the Cult's 
Faith
 is too low.
A traitor is spreading falsehoods about you. 
Other Followers
 may also be led astray.
Re-educate them, or put them in 
Prison
 to bring them back in to the loving embrace of the Cult ... or just sacrifice them. You make the rules, after all.
Imprisoned Dissenters are considered 
Guilty
 by other Followers, meaning there will not be Faith penalties for 
reeducating
 them.
Sickness
Unsanitary conditions at your Cult will cause your Followers to become 
sick. 
If a Follower becomes sick, assign them to 
Bed Rest
 or they could die. Resting will allow them to slowly recover. 
Poop, vomit and dead bodies cause illness to spread quickly throughout your Cult.
Cleaning messes and burying bodies will prevent the spread of illness.
Demons
Followers
 can be possessed by the soul of a 
Demon
 to fight by your side on your next crusade.
Convert a 
Follower
 into a 
Demon
 for extra firepower when entering your next crusade run.
Demons
 will help fight against 
Enemies
when on a 
Crusade
. They cannot be killed.
Once you have completed or failed a crusade run, the 
Demon
 will be converted back into a 
Follower.
Missionaries
Send 
Followers
 away on missions to collect 
Resources.
Missionaries allow you to send your 
Followers
 off to retrieve more 
Resources
, or even recruit 
Followers.
But be careful! Missions may 
fail
, and can result in your 
Follower dying.
Beware: The more often a Follower has gone on a mission, the higher the chance of something going wrong!
Weddings
Congratulations on your 
marriage!
Everyone enjoyed the 
wedding
 and you have raised the Faith of the Cult.
You can 
marry
 as many Followers as you like. It's your Cult, after all.
However, your spouses will become increasingly 
jealous
 every time you remarry.
New Recipe
You have discovered a new 
recipe!
New recipe's can be found by 
mixing
 together different 
ingredients.
Meals provide different levels of 
hunger
 and 
faith.
Select the 
recipe tab
 to choose a recipe. The best ingredients for the meal will be automatically selected, so long as you have enough of them.
Weapon Wheel
You've unlocked a new 
Weapon.
 Change between them using the 
Weapon Wheel.
Each new 
Weapon
 is added to a slot on the 
Weapon Wheel.
Hold 
 to open the wheel then select your preferred weapon and release 
 to equip.
Perform 
Rituals
 to unlock new 
Weapons
Curse Wheel
You've unlocked a new 
Curse.
 Change between them using the 
Curse Wheel.
Each new 
Curse
 is added to a slot on the 
Curse Wheel
Hold 
 to open the 
Curse Wheel
 then select your preferred curse then release 
 to equip.
Perform 
Rituals
 to unlock new 
Curses
Food
Your Followers need to eat and it's up to you to provide meals 
 for them.
The hunger of your Cult can be seen on the top left of the screen. When this gets too low, Followers will begin to starve.
Find more food while crusading - pick routes that pass through foraging locations.
Plant farms to grow your own food. Seeds can be purchased or found whilst crusading.
Dead Followers
A Follower has died! Commiserations on your loss.
Corpses are not good for sanitation and are likely to cause other Followers to get sick.
You need to bury your Follower in a 
Body Pit
 or 
Grave
 to prevent them from going rotten.
Of course, that is a lot of meat to just go to waste...
Fleeces
You have found all four pieces of a 
Holy Talisman.
Talisman's are mystical relics that the Red Crown can use to unlock new 
Fleeces.
Unlock and equip 
Fleeces
 using the 
Doctrine Book
 at the altar in your 
Temple.
The Darkness Within
You have unlocked a new 
Crown Ability.
You will begin each new crusade with a Diseased Heart.
Diseased hearts damage all enemies in the room when you take a hit.
Resurrection
You have unlocked a new 
Crown Ability.
Death is no longer the end. When killed on a crusade you may sacrifice a Follower to be resurrected and continue your run.
The Hunger
You have unlocked a new 
Crown Ability.
Once a day eat a meal 
 to receive a 
Omnipresence
You have unlocked a new 
Crown Ability.
Focus whilst on a Crusade run to instantly return to the base.
Heart of a Heretic
You have taken the beating heart of a heretic.
The Red Crown can feast upon this heart and unlock new powers. Visit the shrine at Ratau’s hut to unleash the true power of the Red Crown.
A Shepherd Without a Flock
Without a Cult, survival is impossible. You have two days to gain at least one Follower.
If you fail to do so, death will be permanent and the game will come to an end.
Unlock and equip 
Fleeces
 from the Altar in your 
Temple.
The Red Crown can feast upon this heart to unlock new Crown Abilities. Visit the Altar in your Temple to unleash the true power of the Red Crown.
Commandment Stone
You have found enough fragments to form a 
Commandment Stone.
Commandment Stones
 are used to declare new 
Doctrines
 for your Cult to follow.
Use the Altar in your Temple to declare a new 
Doctrine
 whenever you form a new 
Commandment Stone.
Divine Inspiration
Collect Devotion 
 from your Shrine. Once you collect enough you will unlock 
Divine Inspiration.
The more Followers worshipping at your shrine, the faster they will fill up. If the shrine is full, they will stop worshipping until it is emptied.
Once you have collected 
Divine Inspiration
 unlock new buildings for your Cult through the Shrine.
Burnt Food!
You have burnt this meal and it cannot be eaten by your Followers. Clean away this unsightly mess.
Cook more food so your Followers actually have something to eat, and be more careful next time!
Fervour
Fervour 
 is the righteous anger earned by striking down non-believers and works like ammunition for your Curses.
Fervour 
 will drop when you slay an enemy. Collecting it refuels your Curses.
Increase a Follower's 
Loyalty
 and they will eventually give you Devotion 
 and a Commandment Stone Fragment 
You can also perform Sermons and many other actions to increase their 
loyalty.
Perform 
Rituals
 in the Temple. These usually raise 
Faith
 or help you solve problems in the Cult.
Rituals
 are performed using the bones 
 of your fallen enemies.
After slaying a non-believer, desecrate their bodies to gather their bones, and use them to perform dark rituals at your Temple.
Crusade Onward!
Now you have defeated the Bishop of this area you may continue onward.
Greater rewards await the further you venture.
But beware, if you don't have the 
Omnipresence
 Crown Ability you will not be able to return to the Cult until you reach another teleporter.
Only continue onwards if you are prepared to leave your Cult for a little while longer.
Cult Trait
You have declared a Doctrine which has imbued your Followers with a new 
Trait.
This 
Trait
 will be applied to all members of the Cult, and will change how their 
Faith
 is affected by events.
Follower Action
You have declared a Doctrine which has granted you a new Follower Action.
When interacting with Followers this action will be available to you.
Perform any Ritual in your Temple
Strength Through The Flock
Through the faith of your Followers you grow stronger.
Performing Sermons will draw power from them and allow you to unlock new abilities, weapons and curses.
Followers with a higher Loyalty level will generate more 
Devotion
. Therefore the more Followers you have and the more Loyal they are, the quicker you will gain new 
abilities.
Blessed Meals
You can now create 'Blessed' meals which will satisfy Follower's hunger significantly more.
When cooking, target the yellow area to bless the meal.
Each time a Follower levels up, they will generate additional 
Devotion
 when at a Sermon or worshipping at the Shrine. So be sure to cultivate their 
Loyalty.
Increase a Follower's 
Loyalty
 to level them up, and they will reward you with Devotion 
 and a Commandment Stone Fragment! 
You can also give them 
gifts,
 complete 
quests
 for them, perform 
Sermons
 and many other actions.

You honour me, great Leader! I am eternally grateful.
Great Leader, I need your help! Will you do a quest for me?
Please Leader, if you would do this quest for me I'd be ever so grateful!
Glorious Leader, your loyal Follower begs your assistance. Will you help me?
Great Leader, I have already given everything I own to you, now I wish to also give my life. Please, sacrifice me in your glorious name.
Please Leader, we have given you everything we own and we are all so poor now. Grant us some of your wealth. Let us share in your Gold.
Glorious Leader, everyone misses 
 dearly, is there a way to bring them back? ...any way at all?
The days are dragging and blurring together. We need inspiration! Please, 
enlighten
 us!
Great Leader, we are exhilarated by your teachings, we adore you and we are ready to commit ourselves to you and work to the glory of the Cult!
We are all exhausted, please let us have a break. We wish to observe the sabbath.
Many of us have managed to save some spare coin. To show our gratitude we wish to donate it to you and the Cult!
Leader, it's getting too relaxed around here. We need to encourage the others to develop spiritual strength, and learn to resist temptation. Let us be tested with a Fast!
Great Leader, there are rumours that you can command the crops to grow. Is this true? We wish to see it!
Glorious Leader, we are all grieving 
. It would help if we could give them the proper send off they deserve.
Great Leader,

Great leader, I... like you... No! I 
love you!
 Would you make me the happiest creature in the world and marry me?
Listen Leader, I'll cut to the chase: I want to be the 
Loyalty Enforcer.
 Let me prove that I am the right person for the job!
Please Leader, I wish I to be more use to you! I have so much more to offer... say, why don't you let me enforce the tax collection at this Cult?
Glorious Leader, we wish you to take us on a spiritual journey. Bend our conceptions of space and time with those mystical 
Menticide Mushrooms.
We have been talking and we are tired of the food here. We need some variety. Please, would you make us some fish dishes?

Great Leader, there are rumours going around that we don't have enough food. Please prove us wrong by making some meals!
Great Leader, we would love if you would cook us some 
's
 for our sustenance.
Great Leader, do you think we could have something extravagant to eat soon, like maybe some 
's
Glorious Leader, the base is an eye sore, we need beauty to celebrate your glory! Let us build

Leader, all of us loyal Followers would love to get together and have a splendid dinner! Do you think you could throw us a feast?

Pardon me, Leader, I would love some of the flowers from Darkwood Dungeon, if you could collect some.
Excuse me, Leader! I would love some mushrooms from 
Anura...
 Just to look at, I swear!
O wonderful Leader, I want some crystal shards from 
Anchordeep
 to decorate my home. Would you mind?
Leader, could you collect some spider silk from 
Silk Cradle
 for me?
Leader, my brother and I were traveling together through Darkwood and were separated. I never knew what became of him… do you think you could find out?
Leader! I'm in love! But 
 doesn't know I exist… would you gather ten flowers for me from Darkwood so that I might woo them?
Thank you, Leader! Now I just need to work up the courage to talk to them…
Leader, I gave 
 flowers but it’s not enough! I need to WOW them. Can you make a delicious meal for us to share?
Thank you, thank you! This will definitely win their heart.
Leader, my heart is in pieces. My love loves another! 
 has taken them from me, and I demand satisfaction. I want to fight!
I have won their heart!
Great Leader, I was telling 
 how much you have done for us and they… they… they fell in love with you instead! I can’t compete with one such as you… will you marry them?
Although my heart is broken, I’m happy that the both of you are happy.
Leader, my brother and I were traveling together through Darkwood and were separated. I never knew what became of him… do you think you could find out?
Oh Leader, I am so grateful! My brother is here at last!
Leader, my brother 
 has joined us here and… and… I can’t stand him! Our whole lives he has overshadowed me, but no more. Let us fight!
I knew he would be no match for me!
Leader, thank you again for rescuing 
! In fact, he is so grateful that he wishes to marry you. What do you say, great Lamb?
Huzzah!
Hey… Leader… I know that you’re married to 
 already but… I… I… I’m in love with you! Would you ever consider… I mean, would it be possible… will you marry me too?
This is the happiest day of my life!
Leader! These new recruits have no work ethic. If you ask me, they should have to prove themselves. Make them work through the night!
Excellent! That’ll show them.
Leader, the new Followers around here have grown too used to a certain way of living. Strife creates character! I think simple meals for a while, don’t you?
Yes! One less temptation for the tempted.
Leader, I was thinking… these newbies have worked hard, and proven themselves. Perhaps we should light the firepit and have a night off? Only if you think it wise, Leader!
Wonderful! I’ll spread the word.
Pathetic Lamb. This is what your labors have wrought? This place holds not a single candle to the magnificence of my Temple, now gone.
Hmf. Adequate.
Leshy was a being of chaos. The unordered beauty of his realm… I wonder if the flowers still grow without his presence.
I asked not for these! You think me a soft fool!? Damned Lamb…
It is a testament to the strength of my Crown, that you should traverse 
Anura
 and emerge unscathed. Even after I cut her throat, Heket’s words were more toxic and foul than the mushrooms that grew in her domain.
Ha! Vile things, still they persist. As vile things are wont to do.
Do you fear me, Lamb? My brother, 
Kallamar
, lived in fear of me. He shook at the mere thought of death! In his temple he thought himself safe. How I wish to see those crystal walls crumbled!
So this is all that persists of 
Kallamar’s
 temple. It was a thing of beauty, once.
…did 
Shamura
 weep, when you fought? Did they know what was to come? Once, they were the brightest of us, their mind gracious and strong like the spider’s silk that encased their home. It reminds me of them…
Lamb, you bear my Crown. You wield my power. And yet I cannot call you worthy. A Follower has perished from this world. What rites is such a pathetic creature afforded?
Hm. So you observe their passing from this world to the next as a ship to sea. Interesting.
Lamb, you bear my Crown. You wield my power. And yet I cannot call you worthy. A Follower has perished from this world. What rites is such a pathetic creature afforded?
Ha! Hahahaha! I cannot begrudge supplantation by one such as yourself. Why contain death? And with none to stand in your way. You are, after all, the last God left in the Lands of the Old Faith.
Lamb. Mortal life is so… fragile. So fleeting. So long did I stand at the gates between this life and the next, trapped at the nexus of what was, and what wasn’t.
…my thanks, Lamb.
Hmm, I dunno about all this… if you were a truly great Leader, wouldn’t this place look… nicer?
I guess that’s a bit better…
If you really are a chosen one, then can’t you make the crops grow with magic or something?
Wow! That’s amazing!
If you really are a chosen one, then shouldn’t the fish be jumping into your net?
Wow! That’s amazing!
Leader, I am ashamed to have ever doubted you. I am steeped in sin! The only thing left for me to offer is your life. It would be an honor to be sacrificed in your name.
Thank you for sacrificing them, I’m sure they are happy now!
Psst! Leader! Rumour has it that 
 is a spy, sent by an enemy Cult to undermine your great power… you should go speak with them and see what they have to say for themselves.
Well obviously they're hiding something! You must believe me, Leader!
Hello, Leader! What a beautiful day in paradise. And might I say, you look extra glorious today.
Leader, 
 continues to masquerade as faithful… something must be done! You need to imprison them!
Thank you for keeping us safe, Leader.
Leader, 
 will not give up their games… I fear you must take care of them. Permanently. Sacrifice them!
You have done what you must for the good of us all. They were a traitor!
Leader, it would be so funny if we pulled some hilarious pranks on 
. They are a real picky eater, so let's make them eat poop!
Haha oh Leader, you are so funny! We are so lucky to have such a leader with such a great sense of humour.
Leader, that was hilarious! Let's do it again. I know 
 will find the funny side of it.
I can't believe they fell for it again! I couldn't stop laughing, how did they manage to finish the whole thing without realising?
Leader, I have our next prank. We put 
 in prison! They will be terrified, it will be so funny.
They were so confused and scared - it was so funny! I'll have to think of how we can top that prank next time!
OK, so it's time to take these pranks to the next level... let's murder 
. It will be hilarious!
Haha I can't stop laughing, the look of terror in their eyes was hysterical! You are too funny! Pranking is the best.
O great and generous Lamb! I have heard some sick followers from Sozo’s seeking refuge in your Cult. Their old Leader has always been capricious, but ever since he got his hands on all those mushrooms… please, Lamb! May they stay?
You are as wonderful as they say!
Leader, I… I… I miss mushrooms! Will you perform the Brainwashing Ritual, please? I need 
mushrooms…
O mighty mushrooms… I mean Lamb…
Give command to your Follower
Excuse me leader, my friend and I were traveling together through 
Anura
 and lost each other. Can you please see if you can find them?
Help Leader! Before you brought me into your Cult my sister and I were separated when travelling through 
Anchordeep.
 Please, can you go and find them?
Please Leader! My best friend is lost in 
Silk Cradle,
 can you go and save them? I would be so grateful!
Follower has already been smooched today.
We already smooched today, let’s smooch again tomorrow!

Senki sem feletlenül a büntetés fölött.
Aludtam, miközben az ártatlan Kultusz tagot újraoktatták.
Kellemes álmaim voltak a sikításról...
Aludtam, miközben az ártatlan Kultusz tagot újraoktatták.
Úgy gondoltam, valamit hallottam tegnap éjjel...
Ártatlan bebörtönözve.
Ez az igazságszolgáltatás tévesztése!
Aludtam, miközben az ártatlan bebörtönözött.

Új szerető.
Ez az igazi, érzem!
Nem kétkedem többé.
Korábban kétségeim voltak, de most már megláttam a fényt.
Nem éhezem többé.
Nem éhezem többé, de nem hiszem el, hogy ez megtörtént!
Nincs templom.
Milyen kultusz az, amelynek nincs temploma?
Öregkor.
Jó életet éltem a szolgálatban, de most fáradttá válok.
Befejtett.
Felfelé haladok!
Propaganda beszélők.
Hallom a Vezető üzenetét, keményebben fogok dolgozni.

Jobban jártam volna, ha nem jössz.
Látta, hogy feldarabolod a halott követőt.
Tudom, hogy a Vezetőnknek megvannak az okai, de mégis...
Látta, hogy feldarabolod a halott követőt.
Mmm, finom, hús vacsorára!
Kétkedő megtért.
Áttértem, de nem vagyok meggyőződve. Lássuk, hogyan alakulnak a dolgok...
Alvás megszakítva.
Kellemetlenül ébredtem fel az éjszaka közepén.
Aludtam egy alvózsákban.
Legalább nem voltam a hidegben, de inkább egy házat választanék.
Aludtam egy alvózsákban.
Egy zacskóban aludni? Elfogadhatatlan. Luxusra van szükségem!
Aludtam egy menedékben.
Kellemesen aludtam az éjszaka során.
Aludtam egy menedékben.
Jobb, de még mindig nem elég jó!
Aludtam egy nagy menedékben.
Mint egy csecsemő aludtam. Imádom a házamat.
Aludtam egy nagy menedékben.
Végre olyan lakhelyem van, amely méltó a pompámhoz.
Odakint aludtam.
Kellene neked építened egy alvóhelyet nekem.
Odakint aludtam.
Én, odakint aludni, mint egy közönséges csavargó?! Elképzelhetetlen!
Átaludtam, ahogy te feldaraboltad a halott követőt.
Úgy tűnt, mintha valamit hallottam volna az éjszaka során, és amikor felkeltem, a test eltűnt...
Valaki elválik a hitünktől.
Zárjátok el a hitehagyottakat! Mutassatok kegyelmetlenül!
Valaki beteg.
Undorító! Jobb, ha nem tüsszent rám.
Egy Kultusz tag meghalt.
Szomorú vagyok, hogy egy társam meghalt a Kultuszban. Nyugodjon békében a lelkük.
Negatív teszt.
Olyan szomorú vagyok valami miatt!
Pozitív teszt 1.
Boldog vagyok valami miatt!
Lelkesedés nélküli új rekrutált.
Úgy gondolom, itt rendben vagyok.
Nem volt prédikáció tegnap.
A vezető nem hirdetett tegnap. Elhagyatva vagyunk?
Prédikációt hallgatott.
Egy inspiráló prédikáció a dicső vezetőnktől.
Prédikációt hallgatott.
Csodálatos volt látni, ahogy a vezetőnk prédikál!
A prédikáció ugyanaz volt, mint tegnap.
Az ugyanazt a prédikációt mondta, mint tegnap. Unalmas!
Dicsőség által fáradozás.
Bizonyságot fogok tenni erényeimről! Egész nap és éjszaka dolgozni fogok.
A vezető megbukott a küldetésben.
A vezető megbukott a küldetésemben... de nem ő az, akinek hősnek kellene lennie?
A vezető boldogságot hozott nekem.
Egy pillanatban feladatot végeztem, a következőben pedig egy börtönben találtam magam! Szép.
A vezető szomorúságot hozott nekem.
Próbáltam elvégezni a feladataimat, aztán a semmiből egy börtönben találtam magam! Szörnyű!
A vezető lehajolt.
Vezetőnk lehajolt egy ellenség előtt? Ilyen gyengeség!
Láttam gyönyörű díszítést.
Milyen gyönyörű! Miért akarna bárki elhagyni ilyen paradicsomot?
Láttam gyönyörű díszítést.
Milyen szépség vesz körül minket... dicsőség a Kultusznak!
Táncoltam a Kultusszal.
Nagyszerű időt töltöttem a táncban a többi Kultusz taggal!
Gyászolok egy eltemetett követőt.
Nyugodjék békében a Kultusz tagja.
Gyászolok egy eltemetett követőt.
Kíváncsi vagyok, mit vár a követőm a túlvilágon?
Gyászolok egy eltemetett követőt.
Annyira hiányzik a szeretőm! Szerencsére a vezető méltó sírt adott neki.
Gyászol egy eltemetett követőt.
Sosem kedveltem azt a követőt, örülök, hogy eltűnt.
Együtt étkezett a Kultusszal.
Nagyszerű időt töltöttem a lakomán a többi Kultusz taggal.
Börtönben újraoktatás.
Gondolataimat helyreigazítják és megtanulom hibáimat.
Visszatért a küldetésből.
Másképp mennek a dolgok odakint... valóban jó úton járunk?
Félelmetes küldetésből érkezett vissza.
A külvilág ijesztő! Soha többé nem akarok elmenni!
Boldogan tért vissza a küldetésből.
A világ többi részét látni ráébresztett, mennyire szerencsés vagyok, hogy ebben a Kultuszban vagyok.
Alamizsnát adom a szegényeknek rituálé.
Nagyon nagylelkű a vezetőnk! Bár nem tudom, mit kezdünk majd az arannyal...
Feláldozott egy idős követőt.
Dicső vezetőnk feláldozott egy időst! Talán a legjobb volt...
Démon legyőzte az ellenséget.
Nagy megtiszteltetés volt a nagy vezető oldalán harcolni!
Kiábrándító démoni menet.
Engedtem, hogy a vezető elesett a csatában... kudarc vagyok!
Hűség erősítve.
Ahogy telik az idő, egyre jobban kedvelem ezt a helyet!
Részt vett egy esküvőn.
Gyönyörű szertartás volt.
Részt venni egy esküvőn házastársként.
Tudom, hogy meg kell osztoznom a vezetővel, de be kell vallanom... féltékeny vagyok.
Házas a vezetővel.
Én vagyok a vezetőnk egyetlen és kizárólagos partnere - engem választottak mindenki más fölé!
Az egyik házastársa a vezetőnek.
Utálom, hogy meg kell osztoznom.
A vezető megcsókolt engem.
Milyen gyönyörű pillanat, nagyszerű vezetőnk olyan szeretetteljes.
Ellenség temetésén részt vettem.
Nem nagyon kedveltem azt a követőt... de szép temetés volt.
Barát temetésén részt vettem.
Nagyon szomorú volt elbúcsúzni a barátomtól, bár szép temetés volt.
Követő temetésén részt vettem.
Bárcsak jobban megismertem volna őt, nyugodjanak békében.
Vezető megölte az idős követőt.
Nem hiszem el, hogy a vezetőnk megsértette az időseket!

Mind a követők közül, el sem hiszem, hogy a vezetőnk egy időst áldozott fel!
A Cult tagja meghalt.
A halál nem a vége, nem vagyok szomorú.
Hajléktalan vagyok.
Szükségem van valahova, ahol alhatok.
Éhes vagyok.
Valamire van szükségem, amit enni, különben éhen halok.
Beteg vagyok.
Pihenésre van szükségem, vagy meghalhatok.
Ellenző vagyok.
Túl alacsony a hit a Kultuszban. Újra kell oktatni, különben talán elhagyom.
Kimerült vagyok.
Olyan fáradt vagyok, szükségem van aludni az ágyban.
Törött ágy
Elromlott az ágyam és meg kell javítani.
